# Track-The-Budget
Initially conceived as a semi-annual CS group project with minimal participation, this Budget Tracker has evolved into an ambitious endeavor that I now plan to complete with friends (this time, for real!). The objective is to develop a functional, user-friendly budget tracker that assists individuals in managing their income, expenses, and financial goals effectively.

This project is part of Hacktoberfest, and we are open to contributions! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, or making improvements, there's a place for everyone to contribute!

# features of the Budget Tracker:

Add Income & Expenses: Users can effortlessly log their income and expenses, categorize them, and store the data in an SQLite database.
Financial Goals: Set savings goals, monitor progress, and visualize how close you are to achieving them.
Visualizations: Utilize bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to get a clear picture of your financial habits.
Summary & Analysis: Access detailed summaries and analyses of your spending habits and overall budget health.
